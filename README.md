# Walmart Data Scraping Project

This project successfully scrapes comprehensive product data from [Walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com/), overcoming multiple security challenges to provide structured data in JSON format. Youâ€™ll find a sample dataset included for reference.

## Project Overview

- **Website**: Walmart.com
- **Goal**: Full data extraction, including product information, pricing, reviews, availability, and more.
- **Challenges Encountered**:
  - **IP Blocking**
  - **Press & Hold Captcha**
  - **Security Layers**: PerimeterX and Akamai Bot Manager

## Solution Approach

To tackle the website's IP blocking and captcha challenges, advanced bypassing techniques were employed. These include:
- **IP Rotation**: Randomly changing IP addresses to avoid detection.
- **Custom Headers and User-Agents**: Mimicking regular web traffic patterns to reduce bot suspicion.
- **Captcha Bypass**: Successfully managed Press & Hold captchas by manipulating IPs and headers.

## Data Fields

The scraped data covers various fields to provide complete product details, including but not limited to:

- **ProductId**: Unique identifier for each product
- **ProductUrl**: Direct link to the product on Walmart
- **ProductName**: Name of the product
- **Category**: Product category
- **ProductPrice**: Current price
- **AvailabilityStatus**: Stock information
- **Rating and Reviews**: Customer feedback
- **ReturnPolicy**: Return options and conditions
- **ProductImages**: Array of image URLs
- **ProductDescription**: Detailed description of the product
